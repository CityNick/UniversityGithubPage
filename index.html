      <h3>Nick Andrei Trivino</h3>
      <p> Hello everyone, I'm a filipino student at City, studying Computer Science with Cyber Security MSCi.
          In terms of programming I have a moderate amount of experience with it, in particular
          when it comes to games, as it was part of my coursework for A levels in which we made a game
          with python. A few of my personal interests are simply coding, gaming, and most of all food ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Platform Game</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2021). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of classes, arrays, subroutines and selection statements to create an
        interactive 2D platoform game. The game is not only able to differentiate between
        different platforms but can also apply collision effects when the player interacts
        with them, dependant on the platform and the parameters used when an instance was
        made. World scrolling with the use of selection statements, also gives the project
        the illusion of a much wider world than what is initally seen in the game window.
        Arrays are also used to cycle between the different sprite images for the player,
        giving the player a more lifelike animation rather than a still sprite.

    <h3>Programming With Java: City Game Coursework</h3>
    <p>

	For my Java coursework I was tasked with creating a game utilising city-engine, a physics engine designed
        by City, University of London. The concept I went for was a simple platformer game in which the player would need
        need to carefully navigate around each level, and avoid numerous bodies such as enemies and spikes and even false
        hearts.<br>
	In this project I had to utilise a variety of techniques including encapsulation, object-orientated programming, inheritance, arrays
        and even the sound and images for visual media.<br><br>
	
	In my game, all bodies which similar methods and attributes are simply designed to inherit from a superclass e.g: Wolf inherits from the super
        superclass Enemy. In doing so I could not only save time on reqriting code but I could also have my collision detectors search for
        instances of the Enemy class instead of have to write different selection statements for Wolf, Golem, Demon etc<br><br>
	
	One issue I had was ensuring all the bodies would move at once. For this idea I came up with the solution of storing all similar bodies into an array
        e.g: platforms are stored in platformArray. This meant that in an enclosed loop I could simply have the code run through each index of the array
        and update them accordingly rather than having to write a new update statement for each object.<br><br>
	
	Another particular issue was the idea the concept of focus. I explain more in the video, but during my time developing I ran into issues where my character
        would not move even though the controls were set correctly and the thing that fixed it was setting the focus on the view.<br><br>
	
	OVerall I have found this project to have been not only quite educating, as I learned a range of new techniques - particularly collision detection, encapsulation and inheritance as
        well as how to save and load a game through the use of a writer / reader into a txt file.<br><br>
	
	Future Improvements I could make would be to include more dynamic Bodies that behave differently and more variations of the platforms and collectibles.<br>
